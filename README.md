# 🛍️ SQL Online Retail 

This project simulates an **Online Retail Company** using realistic mock data generated from **[Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)**.  
The dataset is designed for SQL learning, query practice, and retail analytics using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

The database includes the following five tables:
1. **Customers** – Customer personal and contact details  
2. **Categories** – Product category information  
3. **Products** – Product catalog with pricing and stock details  
4. **Orders** – Customer order-level records  
5. **OrderItems** – Detailed items within each order

## 📁 Files Included

## 📄 **File 1: Create DB Tables.sql**
- Contains SQL scripts to create the database `RetailDB`
- Defines schema and table structures for all 5 tables

## 📄 **File 3 – LOG & Trigger.sql**

To automatically log changes in the database, triggers are used.  
Triggers execute automatically during **INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE** operations.

### **Step 1: Create Log Table**

A general log table is created to capture Records detail

### **Step 2: Create Triggers for Each Table**

#### **A. Products Table Triggers**

- Trigger for **DELETE** on Products  

#### **B. Customers Table Triggers**
- Trigger for **INSERT** on Customers  
- Trigger for **UPDATE** on Customers

## 📄 File 4 – Indexes.sql

This file adds indexes to improve query performance across the database.

### Includes:
- Clustered and non-clustered indexes on **Customers**, **Products**, **Categories**, **Orders**, and **OrderItems** tables  
- Indexes on key columns such as CustomerID, OrderDate, CategoryID, Price, OrderID, and ProductID  
- Temporary dropping and recreating of foreign key constraints where required  

These indexes optimize filtering, sorting, and lookup queries throughout the retail database.

## 📄 File 5 – Views.sql

This file contains SQL views created to simplify complex queries and improve data accessibility.

### Includes:
- **Product Details View:** Combines product information with category names  
- **Customer Orders View:** Shows total orders and total spending per customer  
- **Recent Orders View:** Displays orders placed within the last 30 days  

These views help in quick reporting, easier querying, and improved data organization.

## 📄 File 6 – Questions & Queries2.sql

Contains additional advanced queries using views to analyze:
- Products, categories, and pricing  
- Customer orders and spending  
- Recent orders and latest purchases  
- Low stock items and monthly sales  
- Top customers and detailed order breakdowns  

## 📄 File 7 – Security Features.sql

Implements security and role-based access control (RBAC) for the database.

### Includes:
- Creating SQL Server logins and mapping them to database users  
- Defining custom roles (e.g., SalesRole, MarketingRole)  
- Assigning users to roles  
- Granting and revoking permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)  
- Checking effective permissions for auditing  

This file ensures controlled access to database objects and enhances overall security.
